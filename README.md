# hello-world
This is my first repository

I don't know much about coding but I am going to learn. I am going to practice typing for 10-20 minutes at the start of every morning and then continue to code for at least 2 hours each day.  I will do this Monday through Friday. I start COP1000 on May 18th. I will complete one class over summer and then take two classes in the fall.  I will finish my webdesign certificate by next summer.
